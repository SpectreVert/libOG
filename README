libOG - minimalist non-blocking network I/O & events
====================================================
libOG is a low-level C++ network library providing just enough boiler-plate
to use and monitor event-based, non-blocking TCP/UDP sockets.

disclaimer
----------
The library is currently in active development. Interfaces and
code are not stable and can change drastically.

strictly conventional and simple
--------------------------------
libOG is designed as a weigthless object-oriented layer over the Unix socket
functions. It can be used for writing simple servers and client or as a base
for higher-level asynchronous libraries.

As such, are avoided most c++ features that present potential overhead in
compilation time, code and binary size or readability. Error handling is
done sparingly and with error codes rather than exceptions.

non-features
------------
libOG is not:
 * a general event notification library (libev)
 * an asynchronous framework (libuv)
 * a threading library (libpthread)
 * a $h!tfest of template metaprogramming and dependencies (Boost.Asio)

 documentation
 -------------
 Will be written for release 1.0
