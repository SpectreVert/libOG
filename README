libOG - minimalist non-blocking network I/O & events
====================================================
libOG is a low-level C++ network library providing just enough boiler-plate
to use and monitor event-based, non-blocking TCP/UDP sockets.

disclaimer
----------

strictly conventional and simple
--------------------------------
libOG is designed as a weigthless object-oriented layer over the Unix socket
functions. It can be used for writing simple servers and client or as a base
for higher-level asynchronous libraries.

As such, are avoided most c++ features that present potential overhead in
compilation time, code and binary size or readability. Error handling is
done sparingly and with error codes rather than exceptions.

non-features
------------
libOG is not:

 * a general event notification library
 * an asynchronous framework
 * a task scheduler

requirements
------------
 * a c++11 compliant compiler
 * tup

compilation
-----------
> tup init
> tup
