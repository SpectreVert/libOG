libOG is a minimalist C++ network library providing just enough boiler-plate
to use and monitor event-based, non-blocking TCP/UDP sockets.

disclaimer
----------
The library is currently in active development. Interfaces and
code are not stable and can change drastically.

strictly conventional and simple
--------------------------------
libOG is designed as a weightless object-oriented layer over the Unix socket
functions. It can be used for writing simple servers and client or as a base
for higher-level asynchronous code.

As such, are avoided most c++ features presenting potential overhead in
compilation time, code size or readability. Errors are communicated through
return codes and error handling is left to the user.

features
--------
The typical TCP and UDP classes will be provided by libOG, as well
as some base classes for extensibility reasons:
	
	<> Socket       implemented, base class for socket objects
	<> TcpStream    implemented, TCP client socket
	<> TcpListener  implemented, TCP listener socket
	<> UdpSocket    not implemented, basic UDP socket

+-------------------------------------+
|              ISource                | interface for monitorable source
+-------------------------------------+
|               Socket                | base class for sockets
+-----------+-------------+-----------+
| TcpStream | TcpListener | UdpSocket | specialised classes
+-----------+-------------+-----------+

libOG also has classes aimed at monitoring events:

	<> Poll         implemented (linux), used to monitor event sources
	<> Event        implemented, used to manipulate/examine events

+----------------------------------+
|                IPoll             | interface for monitor of event sources
+----------------+-----------------+
|  Poll (epoll)  |  Poll (kqueue)  | specialised implementations
+----------------+-----------------+

compilation
-----------
Requirements: a c++11 compliant compiler

The library uses tup (http://gittup.org/tup) as a build system. Even though
make is immensely more widespread, I feel like tup is more in tune with the
minimalistic Unix philosophy. You can read the details from the website.

Tuprules.tup contains build macros that you can tune for your needs.

documentation
-------------
There will be extensive documentation generated from the source files and
comments released on 1.0

As of now, the code is mainly self-explainable. Feel free to dive in.
